# Fictional-Organization-Website
A website I made for a fictional organization as a project in a course I took in HTML and CSS

The requirement for the course was to create the website in only HTML & CSS, so
i.e. the navigation bar had to be made for every page. It was not allowed to use
a solution like PHP for this.
