# Fictional-Organization-Website
A website I made for a fictional organization as a project in a course I took in HTML and CSS


At the time I did this project I didn't really use Git, so this commit is the 
first one version on Github. 
However, if you'd like to see the previous versions, they're available in 
the folder /old_versions
